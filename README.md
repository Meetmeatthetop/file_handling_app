# File Handling App

This is a simple Python application that demonstrates basic file handling operations such as reading the contents of a file and appending text to a file. The app is designed to be user-friendly and adheres to Python best practices.

## Features

- **Read File**: Allows the user to read and display the contents of a specified file.
- **Append to File**: Enables the user to append text to an existing file or create a new file if it doesn't exist.

## How It Works

1. The program starts by welcoming the user to the File Handling App.
2. The user is prompted to enter the name of a file to read. If the file exists, its contents are displayed. If the file does not exist, an error message is shown.
3. The user is then prompted to enter text to append to a file and the name of the file to write to. The text is appended to the file, or a new file is created if it doesn't exist.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

If an unexpected error occurs during file handling, the program will display the error message.
